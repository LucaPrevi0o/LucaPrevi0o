## About me
My name is Luca, and I'm not a programmer. But, I like to code, a lot, and I would really like to be, one day, if ever possible, a full-time developer, writing hundreds and thousands of lines of code in a big and complex project (let's face it, it won't probably happen because life sucks... but hey, a man can dream :D and I will for sure). At the moment I'm a third-year student at University of Ferrara, and I'm graduating as an Electronics and Software Engineer.

I’m interested in many things, outside of coding. Mainly, my biggest hobby is Formula 1 (and every other sport regarding wheels and an engine going VROOM, lol), and sucking at videogames. If I ever had to dream bigger than I possibly can, working in any of this environments would be the time of my life. I also am very interested in other activities, such as Rubik's cubes and other kind of puzzles, and I like going for some intense activities, like trekking in the mountains (or maybe skiing in winter, that's also neat) and swimming.

## Personal projects
I'm currently working on JVC (Java VHDL Compiler), a free and open-source compiler and simulator for VHDL projects, entirely based on Java, starting from a project I'm working on for my exams at university.<br>
Ing-Web is also a repository I'm working on because of an exam of mine, and it is based off as a Web application structured over the Java Servlet interface.<hr>
Besides those projects, in my career as a student I mostly worked on network-based Linux applications instead, making use of C libraries to interact with the kernel and the `socket.h` library. But I also worked on the same topics from the Java perspective, working with the standard `java.net` package, as Java is the programming language I'm probably better at.<br>
Apart from that, in my free time I like to experiment a lot in little videogames (I have already done Snake for the third time, I really have to switch from that one), primarily in Java or C++, or get busy implementing little features (like a Matrix library in C++) that I can later implement in other projects (I wanted, for example, to re-build a `List` class in Java, allowing myself to implement that in Snake, just to see if I could handle to manage full parts of a project without help from already established features - even if the same exact thing already existed in the standard Java environment).
